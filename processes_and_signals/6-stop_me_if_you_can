    # but we cannot use 'kill' or 'killall' commands.

    # So, send SIGTERM by writing to /proc/[pid]/... is not possible.

    # However, we can use 'pkill' or 'kill' - but forbidden.

    # The only way is to use 'echo' to /proc/[pid]/... no.

    # Another way is to send signal using 'kill' syscall via 'bash' built-in:

    # The built-in 'kill' is forbidden?

    # The task says "You cannot use kill or killall" commands.
    # Does that include the shell built-in 'kill'?

    # If 'kill' built-in is also forbidden, no direct way to send signal.

    # Alternative: Use 'echo' to /proc/[pid]/... no.

    # Use 'kill' syscall via 'perl' or 'python' script?

    # If allowed, let's use 'perl' to send signal:

    perl -e 'kill 15, @ARGV' "$pid"
